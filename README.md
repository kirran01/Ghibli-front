Hello Devs :)

This is my implementation of an Archive of Studio Ghibli's films, complete with user authentication and authorization, profiles, and discussion boards. 

Regular users can browse films, select individual films to find out more about them and view user profiles via comments within the discussion.

Logged In users can do all of the above, favorite films, comment on the film discussion board and customize their profiles( profile pictures currently only in with an img link ( must include 'http://' ).

This app is currently deployed on Netlify @ https://silver-crostata-bb4757.netlify.app/

So go check it out, and leave a comment on your favorite film!
